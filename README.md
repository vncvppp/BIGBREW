### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd BIGBREW-1
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up MySQL database**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE bigbrewpos;
USE bigbrewpos;
```

4. **Initialize database tables**
```bash
python -m app.db.initialize
```

5. **Configure email settings** (for OTP verification)
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
# BigBrew — Coffee Shop POS (Tkinter + MySQL)

A lightweight Point of Sale desktop app (Tkinter) used for managing orders, users and OTP-based authentication. This README gives quick setup and run steps for local development on Windows (PowerShell).

## Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- MySQL Server
- An SMTP account if you want OTP/email features

Install dependencies

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Database setup

1. Start MySQL server and create a database (example name used below):

```sql
CREATE DATABASE bigbrewpos;
```

2. Update your `.env` (or the defaults in `app/config/__init__.py`) with the correct database credentials.

Initialize tables

```powershell
python -m app.db.initialize
```

Configure email (optional)

Create a `.env` file in the project root (used by the OTP/email utilities):

```ini
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@example.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM=your-email@example.com
SMTP_USE_TLS=true
```

Run the app

```powershell
python main.py
```

## Project layout

- `main.py` — application entry point
- `app/config/` — environment-driven configuration helpers
- `app/db/connection.py` — MySQL connection helpers
- `app/db/initialize.py` — database schema + seed data
- `app/services/` — shared domain services (`shared_state`, utility helpers)
- `app/repositories/` — database repositories
- `app/ui/` — Tkinter UI modules (login, signup, dashboards, ordering, etc.)
- `app/utils/` — additional helper modules
- `resources/` — images and UI assets
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies

Note: There is a nested copy of the project under `New folder/BIGBREW/`. Use the root folder (`C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\BIGBREW`) when running commands.

## Tips & troubleshooting

- If you see database connection errors, confirm MySQL is running and credentials in your `.env`/`app/config` match.
- If OTP emails don't send, verify `.env` SMTP credentials and allow less-secure or app passwords as needed (provider dependent).
- For UI issues, ensure the `resources/` subfolders contain the expected image files referenced by the code.

## Development notes

- The app uses parameterized queries to reduce SQL injection risk and bcrypt for password hashing where implemented.
- Main UI is built with Tkinter — standard desktop app behavior applies (no web server required).
